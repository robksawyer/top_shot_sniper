## FAQ:
* Why isn't it working?
  * Open the Top Shot Helper and see if the "Sort Dropdowns" checkbox is checked. If not, turn it on and click "Save".
  * Refresh the page after making the changes to the settings to see if the issue is resolved.

* How do I know this isn't a virus?
  * The code is open source and I have submitted this to Google for approval on the official chrome extension store.
  * Now officially on chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/top-shot-sniper/leojoakcmcfpoaojibhkepbglljbjjjp?hl=en&authuser=1

* Can you add additional features?
  * Yes this is just the first version, I would consider it a beta. If you have recommendations, contact spencer#1698 on NBA Top Shot Discord.
